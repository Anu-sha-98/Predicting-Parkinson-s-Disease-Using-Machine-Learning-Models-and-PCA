This code predicts Parkinson's disease using speech features by training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree. It preprocesses the dataset, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, and evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. The impact of PCA on prediction accuracy is also analyzed, with results visualized using confusion matrix heatmaps.
